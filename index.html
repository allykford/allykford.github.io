          <p class="description">
            Based on the breakins and burglaries that happened at the beginning of the semester, this <a href="https://medium.com/@allykford/virginia-tech-an-example-of-how-colleges-can-better-protect-students-f02e14933112" target="_blank">blog post</a> describes how colleges can take more steps to protecting their students on and off campus.</p>

          <h2>Stigmas Against VT Majors Podcast</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Are you a college student who faces stigma about your major? Do you feel judged based on your standing as a student? For example, are you a transfer student, have you changed your major more than once, or are you an international student? No one likes to be put down or feel inferior, but it happens, especially when you walk the same halls as other students who study material far different than yours. In today's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-931345620-899076754/cobras-podcast-stigmas-against-vt-majors" target="_blank">episode</a>, we talk about the judgment we've faced as a diverse group of Virginia Tech students.

          <h2>Spanish Lesson 1: Introducing Yourself</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In the <a href="https://youtu.be/v7i4WcdghfQ" target="_blank">first episode</a> of my Teaching Spanish series on YouTube, I will be showing how you can introduce yourself. As a Spanish major at Virginia Tech, I have years of Spanish knowledge under my belt and deeply enjoy spreading that knowledge to other people. Check out this video to find out how you can say, "Hello, my name is..."

          <h2>Students Active for Ending Rape (SAFER)</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Based on the information discussed in my blog post article, this organization aims to end rape culture across all college campuses. Whether it's being aware of your rights or joining their group of student leaders, <a href="https://safercampus.squarespace.com" target="_blank">SAFER</a> works hard to protect all kinds of people on campus from sexual assault.
